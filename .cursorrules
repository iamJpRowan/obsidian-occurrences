# Cursor Rules

## Commit Messages

Always use semantic commit prefixes when committing changes. The standard prefixes are:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example: `feat: Add keyboard shortcut support to modal`
